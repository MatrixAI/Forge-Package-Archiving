#Initial Project Outline Tasks
* Program will be written in Haskell
* Interact with the HTTP API for ipfs for now

-> TODO
* Look into locks, and distributed file systems for managing reader and writer locks into the database
* Look into using stack for management
* Clean up repo

-> PRIORITIES:
* look into integrating writing a package with the IPFS file system. Might also need to investigate how content addressability will map to the existing conduit hash.
